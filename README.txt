This is a repository that holds my attempt at replicating 
and changing the code explained in the video below from Nes Hacker.

https://youtu.be/yEiNs7pKNh8

This video is an introduction to 6502 Assebly which is used on the Nes.
It starts by learning how to modify the x and y registers that would be found
on the 6502 assembler chip found in many early computers and gaming consles.


when this program is ran it outputs a ROM file that can be used through an emulator to see what it does.
My emmulator is FCEUX and because there are no graphics you will need to use the debuger to see the operations
being performed.


When the ROM is ran, it produces an x value of 0f and a y value of 0
x is 0f because it is in hexidecimal from.
0f = 15
